    <h1>Privacy Policy for MyPA Email</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to MyPA Email ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide email services, our app requires access to your email account. We access the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Content:</strong> We retrieve and display email messages and their content on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We securely store an authentication token (OAuth 2.0 token) on your device that allows the app to access your email. We never store your password.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide the app's functionality. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To download and display your emails on your device.</li>
        <li>To sync your email status (e.g., read/unread) with your email provider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for any other purpose, such as advertising or analysis. Your email data is not stored on our servers; it is only stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use modern security standards, including OAuth 2.0, to access your account. This means we never see or store your password. All communication with your email provider is encrypted.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our GitHub repository issues page.</p>
